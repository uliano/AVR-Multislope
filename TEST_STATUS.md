# Test Status (Current)

## Verified
- External 24 MHz clock and TCA0 375 kHz output (PC0)
- Serial output at 115200
- ENABLE sync (PB1 -> PB3)
- K sync (AC0 -> PD3) and gated clock (PC3)
- modN window counting and ISR cadence
- POS count increments and matches N when K is stable

## Pending
- Full integrator hardware test
- ADC differential measurement (PD1/PD4) integration
- End-to-end multislope measurement
